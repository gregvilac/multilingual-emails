## Multilingual Emails with SendGrid

To launch this project, you'll first need a sendgrid account and a dynamic template. Add the necessary variables along with the global variables to the env file. Then install the dependencies and run the client and server.

From the client, you can choose your language as either French, English, or Spanish. After submitting your email, check your inbox to see the email written in the client language you've chosen.
